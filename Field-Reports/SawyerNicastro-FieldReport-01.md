This project lets you visualize and discover the planes that are flying near you. You can open up your camera and see them flying in real time. This is really cool for people who like planes or want to learn more about them. You can see the flight plans and learn about the individual aircraft as well. This project is cool because it informs us more about our environment and gives us context to what is going on.

Created using Swift, this project has two contributors, I'll link their Github's below:
