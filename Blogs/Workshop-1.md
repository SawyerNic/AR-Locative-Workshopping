In this first example, everything went smoothly until I tried to make the object clickable. I added the basic box, changed the box for a model of a penguin and used the recommended CDN to place it in my scene. I don't know if it was because It was a model that I found for free but I couldn't find out why it wasn't clickable. I finally got it working once I added geometry to the entity tag.

This was tougher to develop because I dont believe my laptop, or laptops in general have gyroscopes like phones do. I had to constantly push to my github pages to test this app. Eventually I got it working with a giant cube but I had trouble seeing my penguin model that I used for the last example.
