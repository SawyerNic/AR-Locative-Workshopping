# Workshop 3

[Github](https://github.com/thomasismartinez/igme480-group-10) and [Website](https://people.rit.edu/~tjm7126/igme480/workshop3) for this Project.

For our AR experience we decided to take a piece of RIT graffiti history and preserve the memory of the "Make moves son" house. This house was recently demolished, but it had a long history of being graffitied and painted over. We want to give the user a chance to still see the house have the opportunity to add their own additions to it.

### Prototype:

Our first prototype used just a cube to represent the house. The graffiti appeared by changing the "visible" property of a text object when the "house" was tapped.

Our second prototype swapped one model of a house for another model that had a graffiti textures.
